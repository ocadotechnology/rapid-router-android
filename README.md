# Welcome to Rapid Router for Android
[Rapid Router](https://www.codeforlife.education/rapidrouter/) is an online game aimed at all ages with the primary goal of introducing coding concepts to children at earlier stages in their education. As the world of technology has continued to grow and flourish, this new age demands that we evolve with it, and so comes the demand for applications. We want to give people the opportunity to work with Rapid Router anywhere, on the move, and eventually even offline.

## Our Project
We currently have projects on GitHub that are designing the app version of Rapid Router for iOS. We are also working on developing an Android application alongside, which is where this repository comes in! The aim is to have all the functionality present on the web version available on the go, in a lightweight native solution.

## Getting Started
To get involved with this project, the first step is to clone via HTTPS or SSH. The preferred IDE is [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) as this will offer all the tools you need for getting up and running, and developing new features in no time! The project uses **Kotlin** and **Gradle**, and can be imported as an existing project into Android Studio. A sync will get everything downloaded and up to date. Next add an AVD, like the Pixel C, and ensure it has the Oreo software version. Now you can run the app on this emulator device.

## Where Can I Get Help?
The main contributors to this repository are our Android volunteers, and they are all happy to answer any questions you have.
